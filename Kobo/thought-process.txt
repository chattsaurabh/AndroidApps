Kobo code challenge:

Below are few assumtions and details of some libraries used:

1.	I have used Volley for network call integration.
2.	I have used Picasso for image downloads. Picasso has an inbuilt caching mechanism for images downloaded.
3.  I have implemented a custom Callback for propagating response from API calls to the individual view models
4.	I have used MVVM pattern.
5.	The home screen is fetching the list of users from the 1st API
6.	The user details page is fetching all user details for a selected user from home screen.
7.  Home screen does not have complex list items so I ave used list view
8.	User details page uses a recycler view with view holder pattern which makes the multiple network call integration smoother.
9. 	All sorting and filter use cases are added in the User details page.
